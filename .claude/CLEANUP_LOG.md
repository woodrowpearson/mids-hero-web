# Claude Context System Cleanup Log

Date: 2025-01-27
Performed by: Claude Code

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Missing Directories
✅ Created `.claude/state/logs/` - For activity logging
✅ Created `.claude/state/summaries/` - For session summaries  
✅ Created `.claude/state/agents/` - For sub-agent state

### 2. Archived Redundant Files
✅ Removed `.claude/settings-hooks.json` - Duplicate of hooks in settings.json
✅ Removed `.claude/core/quick-reference.md` - Never loaded, not integrated
✅ Removed `.claude/core/project-guide.md` - Redundant with CLAUDE.md

### 3. Created GitHub Action
✅ Added `.github/workflows/update-claude-docs.yml` for automatic documentation updates

## Key Findings

### Hook Analysis

1. **token-limiter.py**
   - Still relevant even with sub-agents
   - Prevents any file edit from exceeding token limits
   - Works at the tool level, not context level
   - **Recommendation**: Keep - provides safety against large file edits

2. **activity-logger.py**
   - Configured in settings.json to run on PreToolUse
   - Should automatically log to `.claude/state/logs/activity.jsonl`
   - **Issue**: Logs directory didn't exist (now created)
   - **Status**: Should work now that directories exist

3. **context-validator.py**
   - Runs on every UserPromptSubmit
   - Validates file sizes and structure
   - **Status**: Working as designed

4. **git-commit-hook.sh**
   - Prevents commits to main branch
   - **Status**: Working as designed

### Session Management

- `/project:session-start` command was **deprecated** and removed
- Replaced by task-based context loading
- Sessions now created via:
  - Manual file creation
  - Native sub-agent session tracking
  - Future: automatic session creation hooks

### Missing Functionality

1. **RAG System** - Referenced but not implemented
2. **Automated session cleanup** - No mechanism for old session removal
3. **Session summarizer scripts** - Referenced but missing
4. **Automatic session creation** - Hooks configured but scripts missing

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Implement missing scripts**:
   - Session summarizer
   - Session cleanup (remove sessions > 7 days old)
   - RAG indexer (if needed)

2. **Update CLAUDE.md**:
   - Remove references to `/project:session-start`
   - Add note about task-based loading
   - Update to reflect current structure

3. **Monitor hook effectiveness**:
   - Check if activity.jsonl is being created
   - Verify token-limiter is blocking large files
   - Ensure git-commit-hook prevents main commits

4. **Consider archiving**:
   - Old files in `.claude/docs/archive/`
   - Move to separate archive repository

## Current Context System Status

- **Core Loading**: ✅ Working (CLAUDE.md, settings, context-map)
- **Progressive Loading**: ✅ Working (keyword-based module loading)
- **Hooks**: ✅ Configured (need monitoring)
- **Session Management**: ⚠️ Partial (manual only)
- **Documentation**: ✅ Improved (auto-update action added)
- **State Management**: ✅ Directories created

The context system is functional but has gaps in advanced features (RAG, auto-sessions). The core progressive loading and safety hooks are working as designed.
