# Epic 3 Task 3.2 - Build Simulation & Calculation Endpoints

## Overall Progress: 85% Complete

### Completed Phases:

#### Phase 1: Database Integration ✅
- Query power data from database
- Calculate enhancement values from database  
- Load archetype data from database
- Fixed ID type flexibility (string/int)

#### Phase 2: Set Bonus Implementation ✅
- Created enhancement_sets and set_bonuses tables
- Implemented _calculate_set_bonuses() with database queries
- Fixed circular import (renamed schemas to calc_schemas)
- Proper stacking rules (unique bonus per set)
- Integrated set bonuses into aggregate stats

#### Phase 3: Realistic Test Fixtures ✅
- Fire/Fire Blaster with Devastation set
- Controller with mixed enhancement types
- Tanker defense build with LotG
- All tests passing with correct calculations

#### Phase 4.1: MidsReborn Comparison ✅
- Created MidsTotalStatistics schema
- Built comparison framework with tolerance
- Fixed movement constants (14.32 mph, 8 ft jump)
- Implemented auto/passive power calculations
- Basic comparison tests passing

### Remaining Work:

#### Phase 4.2: Edge Cases (0%)
- Test enhancement caps
- Test archetype-specific limits
- Test unusual power combinations
- Validate against known edge cases

#### Phase 4.3: Performance (0%)
- Benchmark calculation speed
- Optimize database queries
- Add caching where appropriate

## Key Technical Achievements:

1. **Database Integration**: All power/enhancement data now comes from DB
2. **Set Bonuses**: Correctly calculate and apply with stacking rules
3. **Auto Powers**: Passive effects (resistance/defense) properly calculated
4. **MidsReborn Parity**: Basic calculations match reference implementation
5. **Flexible Schema**: Handles both string and int IDs for compatibility

## API Endpoint Status:

- `POST /api/calculate` - ✅ Fully functional
- Request: BuildPayload with powers, slots, global buffs
- Response: CalcResponse with per-power stats and aggregate totals
- Database integration complete
- Set bonuses working
- Auto powers working

## Next Session Goals:

1. Create complex comparison tests with enhancements
2. Test ED calculations against MidsReborn
3. Begin edge case testing
4. Update PR description with current status

## Files Modified:

- `/backend/app/services/calculator.py` - Main calculation orchestration
- `/backend/app/calc_schemas/` - Renamed from schemas/ to avoid conflicts
- `/backend/app/calc/setbonus.py` - Set bonus calculations
- `/backend/app/config/constants.py` - Fixed movement speeds
- `/backend/tests/test_api_calc_realistic.py` - Realistic test fixtures
- `/backend/tests/test_mids_comparison.py` - MidsReborn comparison tests
- `/backend/app/calc_schemas/mids_comparison.py` - Comparison framework

## Implementation Notes:

- Auto powers use `power.effects` JSON field for resistance/defense values
- Values stored as decimals (0.15 = 15%) and converted to percentages
- Set bonuses follow "unique per set" rule - max 5 of same set
- Movement constants now match MidsReborn exactly
- Comparison framework allows 5% tolerance for floating-point differences
