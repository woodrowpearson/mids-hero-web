# Mids Hero Web: Modern City of Heroes Character Build Planner

A modern web-based character build planner for City of Heroes, replacing the legacy Windows Forms application with a React/FastAPI stack. This project provides the same powerful build planning capabilities in a modern web environment with AI-assisted development workflows.

## Overview

Mids Hero Web is a complete rewrite of the popular Mids Reborn character build planner, designed to provide the same powerful build planning capabilities in a modern web environment. The application allows players to:

- Select archetypes, powersets, and individual powers
- Plan enhancement slotting with accurate set bonuses
- Calculate build statistics and totals
- Export and import character builds
- Access up-to-date game data from City of Heroes servers

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** with TypeScript for the user interface
- **Material-UI** (planned) for component library
- Component structure with services layer for API integration
- Modern development tooling (ESLint, Prettier)

### Backend

- **FastAPI** for high-performance REST API
- **SQLAlchemy** with **Alembic** for database ORM and migrations
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **Uvicorn** ASGI server for production deployment
- **uv** for modern Python package management (faster than pip)

### DevOps & Deployment

- **Docker** with multi-stage builds
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** (planned) for production deployment
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD with AI-powered workflows
- **AI-assisted development** with Claude integration

## Quick Start 

> **Note**: This project requires Node.js 18+ and Python 3.11+


### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** for version control
- **just** command runner - [Install just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- **uv** (modern Python package manager) - [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Clone and Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/woodrowpearson/mids-hero-web.git
   cd mids-hero-web
   ```

2. **Quick start:**

   ```bash
   just quickstart  # Sets up everything
   just dev         # Start development environment
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>
   - Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>
   - API Documentation: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

### Development Setup

All development operations use the `just` command runner for consistency:

#### Essential Commands

```bash
just quickstart      # Initial setup
just dev            # Start all services
just health         # Run health checks
just test           # Run all tests
just quality        # Code quality checks
just lint-fix       # Auto-fix linting issues
```

#### Database Operations

```bash
just db-setup                      # Complete database setup (recommended)
just db-migrate                    # Run pending migrations
just db-migration-create "description"  # Create new migration
just db-reset                      # Reset database
just db-status                     # Check migration status
just db-connect                    # Connect to database
just db-seed                       # Load sample data
```

> **Database Setup**: The project uses PostgreSQL in Docker for consistency. Run `just db-setup` for automated setup including Docker container management and migration application.

#### Individual Service Development

```bash
# Backend only
just backend-dev

# Frontend only  
just frontend-dev

# API documentation
just api-docs
```

#### Legacy Commands (if needed)

```bash
# Backend development (direct)
cd backend && uv run uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend development (direct)
cd frontend && npm start
```

## Database Setup and Troubleshooting

### Recommended Setup (Docker)

The project uses PostgreSQL in Docker for consistency across development environments:

```bash
just db-setup  # Automated setup with Docker
```

This script:
1. Checks for conflicts with local PostgreSQL
2. Starts Docker PostgreSQL container
3. Runs database migrations
4. Verifies setup

### Database Connection Information

```bash
# Database URL
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mids_web

# Container name
mids-hero-web-db-1

# Admin interface (when running)
http://localhost:8080  # Adminer
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: `FATAL: role "postgres" does not exist`

**Solution**: Local PostgreSQL is conflicting with Docker
```bash
# Stop local PostgreSQL
brew services stop postgresql@14

# Or use the automated setup
just db-setup
```

**Issue**: Docker build fails with `uv: not found`

**Solution**: Docker image build issue (fixed in latest version)
```bash
# Use database-only setup
docker-compose up -d db
just db-migrate
```

**Issue**: Migration fails or tables don't exist

**Solution**: Reset and recreate database
```bash
just db-reset  # Complete reset
```

### Alternative: Local PostgreSQL

If you prefer local PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Create database
createdb mids_web

# Set environment variable
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/mids_web

# Run migrations
just db-migrate
```

## Data Sources

The application uses game data from:

- **Homecoming** (primary): Latest game data from the Homecoming CoH server
- **Rebirth** (planned): Community-maintained server data
- **Generic**: Fallback database for basic functionality

Data is automatically updated through the server's update mechanism, eliminating the need for individual client updates.

## Modern Python Development

This project uses **uv**, a modern Python package manager that provides:

- **Faster dependency resolution** - Up to 10x faster than pip
- **Better dependency management** - Reliable lockfile and conflict resolution
- **Improved developer experience** - Single command for project setup
- **Built-in virtual environment management** - No need to manually create/activate venvs
- **Modern pyproject.toml support** - Standard Python project configuration

Benefits over traditional package managers:

- Faster installs and updates
- Better reproducibility across environments
- Simplified dependency management
- Integrated tooling (linting, formatting, testing)
