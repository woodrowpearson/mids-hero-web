# Agent Coordination Fix Summary - 2025-01-27
Last Updated: 2025-08-25 00:00:00 UTC

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Backend-Specialist vs API-Specialist Confusion
- **Issue**: Documentation suggested overlap between backend-specialist and non-existent api-specialist
- **Resolution**: Clarified that backend-specialist handles ALL API-related work
- **Action**: Updated backend-specialist.md to explicitly state there is no separate api-specialist

### 2. Missing Sub-Agent State Management
- **Issue**: No automatic tracking of sub-agent work for coordination
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive state tracking system
- **Action**: Implemented subagent-state-tracker.py hook

## Implementation Details

### New Hook: subagent-state-tracker.py
- **Triggers on**: Task tool invocation (sub-agent calls)
- **Saves to**:
  - `.claude/state/agents/` - Agent-specific state files
  - `.claude/state/logs/` - Activity logs
  - `.claude/state/summaries/` - Daily summaries
- **Tracks**:
  - Task descriptions and IDs
  - Agent invocation history
  - Session relationships
  - Global usage statistics

### New Documentation: agent-responsibility-matrix.md
- Clear boundaries between all 8 specialists
- Coordination guidelines for multi-agent tasks
- Hand-off protocols
- Example task routing

## Agent Responsibilities Clarified

1. **backend-specialist**: All REST API and FastAPI work
2. **database-specialist**: Schema, migrations, data integrity
3. **calculation-specialist**: Game mechanics and formulas
4. **frontend-specialist**: React components and UI
5. **import-specialist**: Data file parsing and import
6. **testing-specialist**: All testing across domains
7. **documentation-specialist**: Docs and Claude context
8. **devops-specialist**: Deployment and infrastructure

## Testing Results

✅ Hook successfully tracks sub-agent invocations
✅ State files created in all three locations
✅ Agent activity properly logged
✅ Daily summaries generated

## Benefits

1. **Better Coordination**: Clear hand-off tracking between agents
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of agent work
3. **No Overlap**: Clear boundaries prevent duplicate work
4. **State Persistence**: Work continuity across sessions
