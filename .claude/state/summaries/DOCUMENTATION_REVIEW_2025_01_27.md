# Documentation Review Summary - 2025-01-27

## Overview
Completed comprehensive review of all documentation and configuration files to ensure all referenced files exist and content is accurate.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Cleanup
- **Archived 3 redundant files**:
  - `.claude/settings-hooks.json` (duplicate of hooks in settings.json)
  - `.claude/core/quick-reference.md` (never loaded by context system)
  - `.claude/core/project-guide.md` (redundant with CLAUDE.md)

### 2. Directory Structure
- **Created missing directories**:
  - `.claude/state/logs/` - For activity logging
  - `.claude/state/summaries/` - For session summaries
  - `.claude/state/agents/` - For sub-agent state

### 3. Documentation Fixes
- **CLAUDE.md**: Removed references to archived files
- **daily.md**: Updated workflow to remove deprecated session commands
- **.claude/README.md**: Fixed broken reference paths
- **context-map.json**: Removed non-existent automation reference
- **Import guides**: Updated all data file paths to match actual locations

### 4. New Features
- **Created GitHub Action** for automated documentation updates
- **Created CLEANUP_LOG.md** documenting all changes

## Key Findings

1. **Session Management**: The `/project:session-start` command system was deprecated in favor of task-based context loading
2. **Hook System**: All hooks are properly configured, but log directories were missing (now created)
3. **Token Limiter**: Still relevant even with sub-agents - prevents large file edits
4. **Activity Logger**: Should now work properly with created directories

## Current Status

✅ All file references now valid
✅ Documentation consistent with actual file structure
✅ Automated documentation updates configured
✅ State management directories created

## Missing Features (Not Implemented)

- RAG system (referenced but no implementation)
- Automatic session cleanup
- Session summarizer scripts
- Complete workflow diagrams (only one exists)

## Recommendation

The context system is functional for current needs but lacks some advanced automation features mentioned in documentation. Consider either implementing these features or removing references to them.
