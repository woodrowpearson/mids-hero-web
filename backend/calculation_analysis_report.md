# Calculation Implementation Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the current calculation implementation in the Mids Hero Web backend to determine which character attributes are supported versus missing.

## Currently Implemented Attributes

### ✅ Base Stats
- **Hit Points** (Current/Max) - Fully implemented with archetype-specific base values and caps
- **Endurance** (Current/Max) - Base values implemented (100 max, 1.67 recovery rate)
- **Regeneration Rate** - Implemented as 0.42% of base HP per second
- **Recovery Rate** - Implemented as 1.67 endurance per second
- **Damage Bonus** - Fully implemented with ED, global buffs, and archetype caps
- **Healing Bonus** - Fully implemented with archetype modifiers and ED
- **Recharge Time Bonus** - Fully implemented with ED and global buffs
- **Endurance Discount** - Implemented as endurance reduction enhancement
- **Accuracy Bonus** - Basic implementation (enhancement only, no global buffs yet)

### ✅ Movement
- **Running Speed** - Base value implemented (14.32 mph)
- **Flying Speed** - Base structure exists (0.0 default)
- **Jumping Height** - Base value implemented (8.0 feet)
- **Jumping Speed** - Base value implemented (14.32 mph)

### ✅ Damage Resistance (All Types)
All damage types fully implemented with archetype-specific caps:
- Smashing
- Lethal
- Fire
- Cold
- Energy
- Negative
- Toxic
- Psionic

### ✅ Defense
Positional defense fully implemented with caps:
- Melee Defense
- Ranged Defense
- AoE Defense

Typed defense values are also tracked and combined with positional defense.

### ✅ Stealth & Perception
- **Stealth Radius** (PvE/PvP) - Base structure implemented
- **Perception Radius** (PvE/PvP) - Base values implemented (500 PvE, 1153 PvP)

### ✅ Enhancement Categories
The following enhancement types are supported with ED:
- Damage
- Accuracy
- Endurance Reduction
- Recharge Reduction
- Healing
- Defense
- Resistance
- Range (ED implemented but not applied to powers yet)

### ✅ Set Bonuses
The system supports set bonuses for:
- HP percentage increase
- Damage bonus
- Recharge bonus
- Accuracy bonus
- Defense bonuses (melee, ranged, AoE, typed)
- Resistance bonuses (all damage types)
- Regeneration bonus
- Recovery bonus

## Missing/Incomplete Attributes

### ❌ Base Stats Not Implemented
- **Absorption Points** - No implementation found
- **Endurance Consumption** - Only reduction is tracked, not consumption rate
- **To Hit Bonus** - Not implemented (different from Accuracy)
- **Last Hit Chance** - Not implemented
- **Healing Received Bonus** - Not implemented
- **Threat Level** - Not implemented

### ❌ Movement Enhancements
- Movement speed enhancements not applied
- No support for movement power effects
- No caps implemented for movement speeds

### ❌ Debuff Resistance
None of these are implemented:
- Regen Debuff Resistance
- Recovery Debuff Resistance
- ToHit Debuff Resistance
- Recharge Debuff Resistance
- Defense Debuff Resistance

### ❌ Status Effect Protection
None of these are implemented:
- Hold Protection
- Immobilize Protection
- Stun Protection
- Sleep Protection
- Knockback Protection
- Confuse Protection
- Terrorize Protection
- Repel Protection
- Teleport Protection

### ❌ Status Effect Resistance
None of these are implemented:
- Hold Resistance (duration reduction)
- Immobilize Resistance
- Stun Resistance
- Sleep Resistance
- Knockback Resistance (distance reduction)
- Confuse Resistance
- Terrorize Resistance
- Repel Resistance
- Teleport Resistance

### ❌ Other Missing Features
- **Range Bonus** - ED calculated but not applied to power stats
- **Radius Enhancement** - Not implemented
- **Gravity** - Not implemented
- **Max Jump Height** - Only base value, no enhancements

## Partial Implementations

### ⚠️ Accuracy vs To-Hit
- Accuracy enhancements are implemented
- To-Hit bonuses are not implemented
- The distinction between Accuracy and To-Hit is not properly modeled

### ⚠️ Power Activation Time
- Base activation times are stored
- No enhancements or buffs affect activation time

### ⚠️ Auto/Toggle Power Effects
- Basic structure exists for defense and resistance from toggle powers
- Limited support for other effect types from auto/toggle powers

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement To-Hit System** - Critical for accurate hit chance calculations
2. **Add Status Protection/Resistance** - Major defensive mechanics missing
3. **Complete Movement System** - Apply enhancements and power effects to movement

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement Debuff Resistance** - Important for many defensive sets
2. **Add Absorption Points** - Newer mechanic used by several powersets
3. **Complete Range/Radius Enhancement** - Already have ED calculations

### Low Priority
1. **Threat Level** - Primarily for Tanker/Brute mechanics
2. **Gravity Modifications** - Rarely used
3. **Healing Received Bonus** - Less common modifier

## Technical Notes

1. The calculation system uses a modular approach with separate modules for different calculation types
2. Enhancement Diversification (ED) is properly implemented with correct schedules
3. Archetype-specific caps are enforced for damage and resistance
4. Set bonus stacking rules are implemented (max 5 of same set)
5. The system distinguishes between pre-ED and post-ED values for proper damage calculations

## Summary

The current implementation covers the core combat mechanics well (damage, defense, resistance, healing, endurance, recharge) but lacks many of the secondary mechanics that provide depth to character building (status effects, debuff resistance, movement enhancements, etc.). The foundation is solid and extensible, making it straightforward to add the missing attributes.
